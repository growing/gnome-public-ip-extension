# Public IP Address Gnome Extension

This Gnome extension displays information about your public IP address (hostname, country, AS block etc) and a map image of the IP's geolocation. Useful if you use a VPN, or enjoy nerding out over where your internet traffic is traveling through.

Note: the ip data is not retrieved using HTTPS (because that requires a paid account with ipinfo.io), so if you're hiding from the NSA, I wouldn't rely on this extension to determine whether or not you are connected to a VPN.
